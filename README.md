# Thank you for reviewing EcoSteps! 

To run the app...

Prerequisits: 
1. Python3 and PIP
2. Node.js and NPM

## Changing Directories
Open three terminals in EcoSteps project root. For reference: #1, #2, #3

Then, change directory to frontend in #1:

```cd frontend```

Then, change directory to backend in #2: 

```cd backend```

Then, change directory to backend/ai_stuff in #3:

```cd backend/ai_stuff```

## Installation

In the frontend directory (#1), run:

```npm i```

In the backend directory (#2), run:
```npm i```

In the backend/ai_stuff directory (#3), run:

```pip install pymongo openai flask certifi```

Dependencies are now installed!


## Startup

In the frontend (#1)
```npm run dev```

In the backend (#2)
```npm run dev```

In the backend/ai_stuff (#3)
```py working-server.py```

This should start the entire app and activate all functionality.
