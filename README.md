# Thank you for reviewing EcoSteps! 

To run the app...

Prerequisites: 
1. Python3 and PIP
2. Node.js and NPM

## Changing Directories
Open three terminals in EcoSteps project root. For reference: terminal #1, terminal #2, terminal #3

Then, change directory to frontend in #1:

```cd frontend```

Then, change directory to backend in #2: 

```cd backend```

Then, change directory to backend/ai_stuff in #3:

```cd backend/ai_stuff```

## Installation

In the frontend directory (#1), run:

```npm i```

In the backend directory (#2), run:

```npm i```

In the backend/ai_stuff directory (#3), run:

```pip install pymongo openai flask certifi```



Dependencies are now installed!


## Startup

In the frontend (#1)

```npm run dev```

In the backend (#2)

```npm run dev```

In the backend/ai_stuff (#3)

```python3 working_server.py```

This should start the entire app and activate all functionality.
